# Basic Todo App

This app is a basic todo app where you can create, edit and categorize tasks. Authentication is included where you can sign up, login and have your session authenticated.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm] to install all dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

Use the package manager [npm] to run both react and api servers
```bash
npm run dev
npm start
```

## Roadmap

Additional features to be added in the furture:
* UI drag and drop for grouping
* Multi user editing
* local session storage

## Project Status
The app is not completed, I became a bit ambitious with authentication during the 4 hours and ran out of time. 
The APi's for the tasks are currently working. As well as the login and Sign up UI.
With more time on my hands I would definitely fix the cors issue that halted my authentication process. 
I would add additional validation in the backend and frontend to prevent 
SQl Injections and invalid data types, improve styling in frontend, improve error handling,
and especially add tests to both backend and frontend.
